<h4>My Tryst With The North East - The Beginning</h4>
<p class="actual_matter">18th April 2019. India looked forward to a long weekend, I looked forward to my anniversary on 22nd and a peaceful weekend with my family. Little did I know that my weekend would be anything but peaceful. Little did I know that my tryst with the North East would take birth that weekend.

Technically, my tryst did not begin that weekend although the seeds were definitely sown then. It all started with hubby's frustrations and his need to get away from it all. Add to this the fact that we were currently juggling two homes in different cities and rarely getting together as a family. It was indeed time for the holiday bug to bite us hard.

The next few days saw a frantic search of all travel websites and the minute combing of all travel packages in India and abroad. Numerous discussions on the pet peeves of three extremely eloquent and opinionated individuals was the order of the day. My neighbors must either rue the day they purchased their apartments next to us or they probably are used to us and view as free entertainment. Sure, we could put any soap in the shade. Each one of us has their pet peeve and holds on to it with the tenacity of a leech. While one is obsessed with local food and junk jewelry shopping, the other is ANTI relaxed, lie around vacations and looks for paisa vasool holidays. Me, all I want is a room with dark curtains, plenty of comfortable pillows and comforters and room service at regular intervals.

Anyway that was how the discussion flowed. One destination after another was shredded thoroughly and discarded. The challenge was all the "good holidays" had been booked ages ago and in the days that we spent shredding destinations, we had reached a point where we could kiss any holiday requiring a visa goodbye.

Thus, we narrowed down on good old Indian holidays and places with visa on arrival. A further couple of days passed considering visions of lying bhains ki tarah on the beaches of Maldives to alternatively rising from the waves looking like Priyanka Chopra in Dostana.

We came back to Earth. Hubby needed a longer break and I had to admit that nor did I have a Bond girl figure and lying eight days on a beach bhains like would probably turn me into a shriveled prune. So North East it was!!

The next bit was the easiest ever. Chose a good tour operator. Paid full and final. Done and Dusted. Oh Yes!

I am this crazily obsessed person who once a major decision like a holiday or a wedding gets taken, turns into a chalta phirta to-do list. My world becomes a mental visualisation of my suitcase, what to carry, how to carry, why to organise and how to organise. Travel kits and organisers are my best friends. I spend hours exploring online shopping and ordering the cutest organisers which organise anything from shoes to gadgets.

Then reality decided to come a knocking. With all my bags, containers and pouches sorted, I turned to Accuweather and felt as if I had been whacked hard in the pit of my stomach.

It would rain every single day of the eight days that we were on our holiday. While in Tawang for the 3 days, we had an added bonus of thunderstorms as well. Wow! Why on earth could I not check the weather before I did all the so easy banking payments? Why did I lose myself in mega discounts and jumbo discounts and close the holiday in such a hurry? OMG! Now what?

Here started my googling up every single mention of holidays to Arunchal Pradesh in May -June. Reading up every article on it. Most reviewers seemed to be super fit, who wrote reviews and shared pics of trekking through Arunchal in the snow with 4 jeans and loads of jackets thrown into a backpack. Certainly not me.Reviews on Tripadvisor promised pristine beauty, basic amenities, good food, lots of travel and lovely pics.

All very well. Here I am at 90+ kgs struggling to lose weight and keep health problems at bay and all I had wanted was a relaxed, chilled out holiday. Look what I signed up for! Considering I had put my foot in and advised hubby and daughter on choosing tour operator, holiday location and had coerced them to pay in a hurry  dangling all the discounts; two things were clearly emerging. One I was rotten at choosing locations and two, this time I had better put my foot on the treadmill instead of my mouth.

Well, it had to be done. I kept a keen eye on my plate and the weighing scale, downed gallons of green tea like it was my ambrosia and eventually lost 2 kgs.

Now it came to the actual buying stuff, deciding types of clothes etc. I decided to relinquish my Adidas for a lighter Converse and went on to woolens. I pulled my woolens out of my cupboard and my husband put down his paper. Reason, I thrive on woolens during vacations. As a person known to have used a razai, calling a Mumbai winter bitterly cold; an overcoat is my bestie. I pulled it out and could see my husband shaking his head. He eyed me beadily and went, "In India, in May??"

Feeling like the kid whose cookie jar has been snatched away, I dwelt on my new Converse instead. 

Let's pack! Maybe I'll throw in my bestie at the last minute.

More on my tryst coming soon...</p>
